    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. 
            Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. 
            Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. 
            Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.</li>
        <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are 
            beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. 
            Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, 
            making sure to get all of the browned bits.</li>
        <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. 
            Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
